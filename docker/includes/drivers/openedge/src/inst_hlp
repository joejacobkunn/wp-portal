*10010*A JVM has not been detected Help

The Installation Utility cannot find a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on the
platform to which you are installing. You can proceed with the installation
process, but you can only install products that do not require a JVM.

Note: This situation will not occur if you are installing on a platform
for which Progress Software Corporation automatically ships a JVM. For
details about these platforms and others for which the JVM is not shipped,
see the OpenEdge Getting Started: Installation and Configuration guide.


*10020*Detected JVM version does not match the supported version Help

The Installation Utility did not detect the currently supported JVM on the
platform to which you are installing. Your options to proceed are:

- Continue with the current installation, proceeding with the unsupported
  JVM version on your system. However, unpredicatable results might occur.

- Type N to exit the current install at this time. Obtain the supported
  JVM version and install it. Ensure you install it at the beginning of
  the search path ($Path). After you complete these tasks, you must
  re-install.

If you are performing a batch installation, you can add an entry in
the .ini file to permit a batch install to override this warning. See
the chapter "Performing an OpenEdge Installation on UNIX," in the
OpenEdge Getting Started: Installation and Configuration guide.

Note: Progress Software Corporation recommends that you install the
supported JVM version to ensure full functionality.

a complete list of OpenEdge product components and subcomponents.

*10090*Select Destination Pathname Help

About this dialog box

The Select Destination Pathname dialog box determines the directory path for
and location of these OpenEdge installation files:

 - Destination Path  - Identifies where to install the OpenEdge product.
                       For example, /usr1/OpenEdge/110/dlc.

 - Working Directory - Contains your applications, your databases, and your
                       log files. The Working Directory also serves as the
                       default working directory for OpenEdge clients and
                       WebSpeed Agents.
                       For example, /usr1/OpenEdge/wrk.

Consider the following points before you select directories:

 - Do not make your OpenEdge working directory a subdirectory under the
   OpenEdge installation path. If you uninstall OpenEdge, the working
   directory is deleted along with the destination directory. Additionally,
   you cannot start a server for a database that has been installed in a
   subdirectory of OpenEdge.

 - If you have other versions of Progress or OpenEdge products installed,
   do not enter the pathname where these products reside. You must specify
   a different destination path for OpenEdge. This ensures that you do not
   overwrite any of your existing product directories and files.

 - If you want to add OpenEdge products to the most recently installed
   version, the installation program assumes that you are adding these
   products to this install location. For more information, see the
   section that addresses how to install additional products in "OpenEdge
   Getting Started: Installation and Configuration."

Caution: Never run OpenEdge products from the directory in which you
         installed them. If you do, you could damage the OpenEdge software
         files.

Procedure for this dialog box

To select destination and work path directories:

1. Accept the Destination Directory path /usr/dlc (default) or enter an
   alternate directory.

2. Accept the Work Directory path /usr/wrk (default) or enter an alternate
   directory.

3. Press ENTER.  The Type and Destination dialog box reappears.
   The directories you selected appear in the Destination pathname and Working
   Dir pathname fields in the display box that appears below the main dialog
   box.

   Note: The actual key you use to accept the default varies by terminal
         type. The Select Destination Pathname dialog box shows the
         appropriate key combination for your terminal.

The following table describes the menu options for this dialog box:


Option                  Description

1. Choose (highlight) a product name.

2. Do one of the following, as needed:

   - Press ENTER once to deselect the entire product. The product will not be
     installed.

   - Press ENTER twice to reselect the entire product. (If the product
     contains optional and/or required components, these elements are listed
     on the Select Components dialog box.  Press Help on this dialog box for
     details about how to select individual components.)

3. Review the product status information as presented in Step 2 of this
   procedure.

4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for each product listed.

5. Once you have made all your product, component, and subcomponent
   selections, select Install Selected Products. If you are installing any
   product that requires a Web server, the ATTENTION dialog box appears,

*10120*Custom - Select Components Help

About this dialog box

The Custom - Select Components dialog box, the second of three dialog boxes
you can use to customize an OpenEdge product, allows you to deselect and
reselect optional and recommended product elements at the
component level.

The components list is based on the product you selected on the Select
Products dialog box. Optional and recommended components, which have
selectable subcomponents, initially appear with an asterisk (*) to indicate
that the component is preselected for installation, by default. However, you
can deselect each component.

The Custom - Select Component dialog box appears only if there are components
for a product you selected on the Custom - Select Product dialog box.

Procedure for this dialog box

To deselect/reselect product elements at the component level:

1. Choose (hightlight) a component.

   Note: Recommended components are identified by an (r) after the
         component's name. All other components are considered optional by
         default. (Note that the word "optional" after a component is
         actually part of the component's name and not a status indicator.)

2. To deselect an entire component that has an asterisk (*), highlight the
   component and press ENTER once. The component will not be installed.

   Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each component you want to remove from the
   installation.

3. To select a component and review its subcomponent details, highlight the
   component and press ENTER twice. Note these results:

   - If a component contains selectable (optional and/or recommended)
     subcomponents, they are listed on the Select Subcomponents dialog box.
     Each subcomponent is preselected by default, as indicated by an
     asterisk (*). Highlight the subcomponent and press ENTER once to deselect
     a subcomponent, or press ENTER twice to reselect a component. You can
     also select Help on the Select Subcomponent dialog box for more details
